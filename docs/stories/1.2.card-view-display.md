## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the basic profile data structure and Firebase setup. Build upon the user data model and Firebase configuration from that story.

### Data Models
**User Profile Query** [Source: architecture/2-データベース設計柔軟な公開範囲管理例.md]:
```
/users/{userId}
  - core: { name, photoUrl, mainTitle, teamIds, mainSkills }
```

For card view, we primarily need the `core` data which contains the essential display information.

### API Specifications
**Firestore Query Pattern**:
- Query: `users` collection
- Select: `core` subcollection fields
- Pagination: Use Firestore's `limit()` and `startAfter()` for efficient pagination
- No specific API endpoints found in architecture docs - continue using Firestore client SDK

### Component Specifications
**ProfileCard Component Structure**:
- Display: `photoUrl`, `name`, `mainTitle`, `mainSkills` (first 3-4 skills)
- Styling: Card elevation, hover effects, responsive sizing
- Interaction: Click to navigate to full profile view

**CardGrid Component**:
- Layout: CSS Grid with auto-fit columns
- Responsive: 1 column (mobile), 2-3 columns (tablet), 4-6 columns (desktop)

### File Locations
**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/1-システム全体像.md]:
Suggested file structure building on Story 1.1:
- `pages/profiles/index.tsx` - Main profiles listing page
- `components/ProfileCard.tsx` - Individual profile card component  
- `components/CardGrid.tsx` - Grid container component
- `lib/queries.ts` - Firestore query functions (new file)
- `styles/ProfileCard.module.css` - Card-specific styling

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy**: Continue using Jest and React Testing Library
**Card-specific tests**:
- ProfileCard renders with correct data
- Card grid responsive layout
- Click navigation behavior  
- Loading states and empty states
- Pagination functionality

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture/1-システム全体像.md]:
- Use Firestore pagination to avoid loading all users at once
- Implement image optimization for profile photos
- Consider lazy loading for better performance
- Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization

## Testing
**Test file locations**: Adjacent to components with `.test.tsx` extension
**Testing frameworks**: Jest and React Testing Library (consistent with Story 1.1)
**Specific requirements for this story**:
- Test responsive grid behavior with different screen sizes
- Mock Firestore queries for consistent testing
- Test pagination and infinite scroll functionality
- Verify proper loading and error state handling
