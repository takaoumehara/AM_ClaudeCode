# Story 1.4: Modal Comparison View

## Status
Done

## Story

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.3 established profile data structure, card display, and list display. Build upon the existing selection patterns and profile data fetching. The comparison modal will need to work with both card and list view selection states.

### Data Models
**Complete User Profile for Comparison** [Source: architecture/2-データベース設計柔軟な公開範囲管理例.md]:
```
/users/{userId}
  - core: { name, photoUrl, mainTitle, teamIds, mainSkills }
  - personal: { 
      hobbies, favorites, learning, motto, activities, customFields,
      show: { hobbies: { org1: true, org2: false, all: true }, ... }
    }
  - profiles: { orgId1: { ... }, orgId2: { ... } }
```

For comparison, we need access to both core and personal data, respecting visibility settings in the `show` field.

### API Specifications
**Comparison Data Requirements**:
- Fetch complete profile data for selected users
- Apply visibility rules based on current organization context
- Load skill details for common skill identification
- No specific comparison API in architecture - implement client-side comparison logic

### Component Specifications
**ProfileModal Component Structure**:
- Modal overlay with backdrop blur
- Close button and ESC key handling
- Responsive container for comparison layout

**ProfileComparison Component**:
- Side-by-side profile cards
- Common elements highlighting
- Scrollable content areas

**Selection Components**:
- ProfileCheckbox: Selection state for cards/rows
- CompareButton: Floating action button when items selected
- SelectionIndicator: Show number of selected profiles

### File Locations
**Project Structure** building on previous stories:
- `components/modals/ProfileModal.tsx` - Main modal component
- `components/ProfileComparison.tsx` - Comparison layout
- `components/ComparisonHighlight.tsx` - Common elements highlighting
- `components/selection/ProfileCheckbox.tsx` - Selection UI
- `components/selection/SelectionControls.tsx` - Compare buttons and controls
- `hooks/useProfileSelection.ts` - Selection state management
- `hooks/useComparison.ts` - Comparison logic
- `utils/profileComparison.ts` - Common elements detection

### Testing Requirements
**Modal and Comparison Testing**:
- Modal open/close behavior and accessibility
- Multi-profile selection across different views
- Comparison logic for finding common elements
- Responsive layout behavior
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility compliance

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture/1-システム全体像.md]:
- Lazy load full profile data only when comparison is requested
- Implement efficient common elements detection algorithms
- Use React.memo for comparison cards to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Consider using Web Workers for complex comparison calculations

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- Modal focus management and keyboard trapping
- Screen reader announcements for comparison results
- High contrast support for highlighting
- Proper ARIA labels for selection controls

**Privacy Considerations** [Source: architecture/2-データベース設計柔軟な公開範囲管理例.md]:
- Respect user visibility settings (`show` field) when displaying comparison data
- Only show information user has made visible to current organization context

## Testing
**Test file locations**: Adjacent to components with `.test.tsx` extension
**Testing frameworks**: Jest and React Testing Library (consistent with previous stories)
**Specific requirements for this story**:
- Test modal behavior (open/close, backdrop clicks, ESC key)
- Test multi-select functionality across card and list views
- Test comparison logic with various profile combinations
- Test responsive modal layout on different screen sizes
- Test accessibility features including focus management
- Mock complex comparison calculations for consistent testing
