# Story 2.1: Organization Selection During Onboarding

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** new user completing onboarding,  
**I want** to select or join organizations and set up my initial profile context,  
**so that** I can immediately start using AboutMe Cards within the right organizational framework and show appropriate profile information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Organization Discovery & Selection**
   - User can see a list of organizations they've been invited to join
   - User can search for public organizations by name or code
   - User can request to join organizations that require approval
   - User can create a new organization if they don't find existing ones

2. **Invitation-Based Joining**
   - User can accept pending invitations from their email
   - Invitations show organization name, logo, and brief description
   - User can decline invitations with optional feedback

3. **Profile Context Setup**
   - After selecting primary organization, user sets up their initial profile
   - User can choose which profile fields to show/hide for this organization
   - User gets guidance on completing profile sections relevant to this org type

4. **Multiple Organization Handling**
   - If user has multiple org invitations, they can select primary organization
   - User understands they can switch organizations later
   - Clear indication of which org context they're currently setting up

5. **Onboarding Completion**
   - User successfully enters their first organization's AboutMe Cards view
   - User receives brief tutorial on switching organizations if they have multiple
   - User's profile is properly scoped to the selected organization

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Architecture Context:**
- Organization data structure supports multiple memberships per user
- Profile visibility settings are organization-scoped in user data model
- Authentication flow integrates with organization invitation system

**Key Integration Points:**
- Links with authentication system for invitation validation
- Connects to organization management APIs
- Integrates with profile creation and editing systems
- Works with the organization switching mechanism (Story 2.2)

**Database Schema Requirements:**
```sql
-- Organization membership model needed
organizations: {id, name, logo, description, type, member_count}
user_organizations: {user_id, org_id, role, joined_at, status}
org_invitations: {id, org_id, email, status, invited_by, created_at}
```

**API Endpoints Needed:**
- GET /api/organizations/search
- GET /api/organizations/invitations/{email}
- POST /api/organizations/join
- POST /api/organizations/create
- POST /api/invitations/respond

**Performance Requirements:**
- Organization search returns results within 500ms
- Page transitions feel instant (optimistic UI)
- Works with slow network connections

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for organization selection logic
- Integration tests for invitation handling
- E2E tests for complete onboarding flow
- Test multiple organization scenarios
- Mobile responsiveness tests
- Performance tests for search functionality
