## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established profile data structure, Story 1.2 created card display. Build upon the existing Firestore queries and data fetching patterns from previous stories.

### Data Models
**Extended User Profile Data** [Source: architecture/2-データベース設計柔軟な公開範囲管理例.md]:
```
/users/{userId}
  - core: { name, photoUrl, mainTitle, teamIds, mainSkills }
  - personal: { hobbies, favorites, learning, motto, activities, customFields, show: { ... } }
```

For list view, we need both `core` and relevant `personal` data for comprehensive display.

**Team and Skill References**:
```
/skills/{skillId}: { name, synonyms, orgIds }
/teams: Referenced by teamIds in user core data
```

### API Specifications
**Enhanced Firestore Queries**:
- Need to fetch more complete user data (core + personal)
- Implement client-side sorting and filtering for better UX
- Consider compound queries for skill-based filtering
- Use Firestore's `where()` clauses for team filtering

### Component Specifications
**ProfileTable Component**:
- Columns: Photo (small), Name, Title, Skills (tags), Teams, Projects
- Sortable headers with up/down arrows
- Row hover effects and click handling

**Filter Components**:
- SkillFilter: Multi-select dropdown with skill names
- TeamFilter: Checkbox list of available teams
- SearchBox: Real-time search input with debouncing

### File Locations
**Project Structure** building on previous stories:
- `pages/profiles/list.tsx` - List view page
- `components/ProfileTable.tsx` - Main table component
- `components/filters/SkillFilter.tsx` - Skill filtering
- `components/filters/TeamFilter.tsx` - Team filtering  
- `components/SearchBox.tsx` - Search functionality
- `hooks/useTableSort.ts` - Sorting logic hook
- `hooks/useProfileFilters.ts` - Filtering logic hook

### Testing Requirements
**Table-Specific Testing**:
- Verify column sorting works correctly for different data types
- Test filter combinations and search functionality
- Test responsive table behavior
- Verify performance with large datasets
- Test accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture/1-システム全体像.md]:
- Implement client-side sorting/filtering for responsive UX
- Use virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Debounce search input to avoid excessive queries
- Cache filtered results to improve performance

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- Proper ARIA labels for sortable columns
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support

## Testing
**Test file locations**: Adjacent to components with `.test.tsx` extension
**Testing frameworks**: Jest and React Testing Library (consistent with previous stories)
**Specific requirements for this story**:
- Test sorting algorithms with various data types
- Test filter combinations and edge cases
- Test search functionality with special characters
- Test responsive table layout on different screen sizes
- Test accessibility features with testing-library/jest-dom
