// Firebase Admin SDK setup
// Note: This requires service account credentials which are not included in client apps
// For demo purposes, we'll create a placeholder that won't work without proper setup

export const adminDb = null as any;
export const adminAuth = null as any;

// To use Firebase Admin SDK:
// 1. Go to Firebase Console -> Project Settings -> Service Accounts
// 2. Generate new private key
// 3. Save the JSON file securely (never commit to git)
// 4. Set up environment variables for the service account
// 5. Initialize admin SDK with the credentials

// For now, we'll use a client-side approach for demo data generation
